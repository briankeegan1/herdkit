# scripts/herd/sim/sandbox-resolver-respawn-scenario.sh — HERD-55 RESOLVER-RESPAWN scenario.
#
# Proves the watcher re-spawns a stale/failed conflict resolver when a CONFLICTING PR's head sha
# changes or the dispatched resolver dies — instead of stranding the PR CONFLICTING until a human
# notices. It drives the REAL watcher decision code (agent-watch.sh sourced in lib mode) — the
# SHIPPED functions `_classify_conflict`, `spawn_resolver`, and the sha-keyed resolve ledger helpers
# (resolver_dispatch_count / resolver_dispatched_sha / resolver_escalated_sha / resolver_last_sha) —
# not a re-implementation. Each tick calls `_classify_conflict` exactly as the classification pass
# does, then mirrors the resolve pass (journal resolver_respawn + spawn_resolver) exactly as
# agent-watch.sh does, so the accounting under test is production code and this breaks if it regresses.
#
# It fakes the two external inputs deterministically (the stub-gh seam conventions of
# sandbox-concurrency-scenario.sh):
#   • the PR's CONFLICTING mergeStateStatus and its HEAD SHA — a plain shell variable the tick reads,
#     bumped to fake a new commit;
#   • the resolver agent liveness ($AGENTS_JSON, the driver roster the watcher parses) and the
#     resolver's terminal verdict (the sha-scoped $HERD_RESOLVE_RESULT_FILE the resolver writes) — via
#     a stub resolver on the HERD_RESOLVE_BIN seam (mirrors HERD_REVIEW_BIN).
#
# Scorecard checkpoints (the required chain dispatch → death → new-sha respawn → cap, plus the
# terminal-escalate and live-hold rails):
#   (1) first_dispatch     — first CONFLICTING tick dispatches ONE resolver, sha-keyed.
#   (2) alive_holds        — while the resolver agent is alive + no verdict, NO second dispatch (hold).
#   (3) dead_respawn       — resolver dies (agent gone, no verdict) → RE-dispatch for the same sha.
#   (4) new_commit_respawn — a NEW head sha → RE-dispatch for the new sha (journaled resolver_respawn).
#   (5) respawn_capped     — after REFIX_MAX_ROUNDS dispatches, NO further dispatch; row = "gave up".
#   (5b) new_commit_holds_while_alive — a NEW sha while the prior resolver is STILL alive HOLDS (never
#        double-dispatches onto the same worktree); re-dispatches only after that resolver has exited.
#   (6) escalate_terminal  — an ESCALATE verdict is terminal for its sha: recorded + never re-dispatched.
#   (7) journal_trail      — every respawn emitted a resolver_respawn journal event with old/new sha.
