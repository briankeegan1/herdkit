"""herd.shadow_journal — the shadow watcher's append-only journal (HERD-316, P3c, EPIC HERD-300).

Part of the strangler port of the engine core. This is the P3 SHADOW-MODE writer: the Python
watcher (:mod:`herd.shadow_runtime`) runs BESIDE the live bash watcher in DRY-RUN mode and its
sole output is a journal — so the P3 acceptance gate can diff the two event streams (same inputs
→ same events; ``docs/spikes/engine-port-python.md`` §3, P3). Two hard rules make that safe:

  1. **A SEPARATE FILE.** The shadow journal is ``.herd/journal-shadow.jsonl``, NEVER the live
     ``.herd/journal.jsonl`` the bash engine owns. The shadow runtime mutates NOTHING the real
     engine reads — the journal-shadow file is the entire footprint of a shadow run (the DRY-RUN
     non-negotiable: no gh, no merges, no pane ops, writes ONLY to journal-shadow.jsonl).

  2. **BYTE-IDENTICAL EVENT SHAPES.** Every line this writer emits is encoded to be
     indistinguishable from what ``scripts/herd/journal.sh`` would have written for the same
     ``(event, kv…)``, so the parity diff compares like with like. The port MUST NOT change the
     journal schema — it is the cross-implementation parity oracle (contract §7, journal.sh §3.1).

This module therefore re-implements ``journal.sh``'s encoding contract in stdlib Python, faithful
to the bash down to the JSON separators:

  * ``{"ts": …, "event": …}`` FIRST, in that order, then the caller's key/value pairs in order
    (``journal.sh:134``). Python dicts preserve insertion order, matching the bash construction.
  * ``ts`` comes from ONE UTC source (:func:`_journal_ts`, mirroring ``journal.sh:33``) —
    ISO-8601, always ``Z``-suffixed — with the ``HERD_JOURNAL_NOW`` test seam that overrides the
    clock with a caller-supplied string (``journal.sh:34``). No caller formats its own time.
  * Integer-looking values serialize as JSON NUMBERS, everything else as strings, using the exact
    bash predicate ``v and v.lstrip("-").isdigit()`` (``journal.sh:141``–:145). ``"-"`` alone,
    ``""`` and non-digit strings stay strings; ``"-5"``/``"007"`` become ``-5``/``7`` — same as the
    bash ``int(v)``.
  * ``json.dumps(obj, separators=(",", ":"), ensure_ascii=False)`` — the identical serialization
    call ``journal.sh:147`` shells out to.
  * ONE ``O_APPEND`` write of ``line + "\n"`` (``journal.sh:152``); each line stays well under
    PIPE_BUF so concurrent shadow writers interleave whole lines with no lock (journal.sh §"ATOMIC").

And faithful to the bash SAFETY contract: :func:`ShadowJournal.append` is BEST-EFFORT and SILENT —
it wraps its work so an unwritable path, a missing directory it cannot create, or any encoding
error simply drops the entry and returns; it NEVER raises into the shadow runtime's task graph
(``journal_append`` "ALWAYS returns 0", journal.sh §CONTRACT). A dropped shadow entry is a parity
miss, never a crash.

Stdlib-only (the P1 packaging rule): no third-party deps. Run indirectly via
:mod:`herd.shadow_runtime`; unit-driven by ``tests/test_shadow_runtime.py``.
